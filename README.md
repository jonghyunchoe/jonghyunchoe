Hi, I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Seoul National University, and I'll be starting my master's at Carnegie Mellon University this fall.

I am interested in areas of large-scale systems, computer architecture, and hardware/software co-design. My goal is to optimize emerging workloads across the software, hardware stack to improve the efficiency of large-scale systems.
